        "text": "For the iodine anion in question, we can determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons as follows:\\n\\n$$1$$. Protons: The atomic number of iodine (I) is $$53$$, which means it has $$53$$ protons.\\n\\n$$2$$. Neutrons: The mass number is given as $$127$$. The number of neutrons can be found by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number:\\n\\nNumber of neutrons $$=$$ $$127$$ - $$53$$ $$=$$ $$74$$\\n\\nSo, there are $$74$$ neutrons.\\n\\n$$3$$. Electrons: Since this is an iodine anion (I\u207b), it has gained one extra electron. Normally, a neutral iodine atom has $$53$$ electrons (equal to the number of protons). With the extra electron, the total number of electrons in the I\u207b anion is:\\n\\nNumber of electrons $$=$$ $$53$$ + $$1$$ $$=$$ $$54$$\\n\\nThus, one iodine anion (I\u207b) has:\\n- $$53$$ protons,\\n- $$74$$ neutrons, and\\n- $$54$$ electrons.",
