        "text": "To determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in an iodine anion (I⁻), we can break it down as follows:\\n\\n$$1$$. $$\\textbf{Number of protons}$$: The atomic number of iodine (I) is $$53$$, which means iodine has $$53$$ protons in its nucleus. The number of protons defines the element.\\n\\n$$2$$. $$\\textbf{Number of neutrons}$$: The mass number of iodine is given as $$127$$. The mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons:\\n\\n$$\\text{Number of neutrons} = \\text{Mass number} - \\text{Number of protons}$$\\n\\n$$\\text{Number of neutrons} = 127 - 53 = 74$$\\n\\n$$3$$. $$\\textbf{Number of electrons}$$: A neutral iodine atom has $$53$$ electrons, equal to the number of protons. However, since we are dealing with an iodine anion (I⁻), it has gained one extra electron:\\n\\n$$\\text{Number of electrons} = 53 + 1 = 54$$\\n\\nSo, for the iodine anion (I⁻):\\n- $$\\textbf{Protons}$$: $$53$$\\n- $$\\textbf{Neutrons}$$: $$74$$\\n- $$\\textbf{Electrons}$$: $$54$$",
