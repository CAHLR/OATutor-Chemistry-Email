        "text": "From the provided image and given answer, we can summarize the analysis of the wave characteristics as follows:\\n1. $$\\textbf{Wavelength}: \\n- The wavelength is the distance between two consecutive points where the wave repeats itself (e.g., from crest to crest or trough to trough).\\n- From the image and based on the information that each square represents one unit, the distance over which the wave repeats (one full cycle) appears to be 7 units.\\n 2. $$\\textbf{Amplitude}: \\n- The amplitude is the maximum displacement from the wave's equilibrium position (the center line).\\n- The wave reaches a maximum height of 3 units above and below the centerline, meaning the amplitude is 3 units.\\n3. $$\\textbf{Nodes}:$$ \\n- Nodes are points where the wave crosses the equilibrium line and has zero displacement.\\n- Counting the number of times the wave crosses the centerline, there are 6 nodes shown in the image.\\n4. $$\\textbf{Antinodes}$$: \\n- Antinodes are points where the wave reaches its maximum positive or negative displacement (the crests and troughs).\\n- There are 6 antinodes, corresponding to the peaks and troughs visible in the image.\\nThus, the final characteristics of the wave are:\\n- $$\\textbf{Wavelength}$$ = 7 units\\n- $$\\textbf{Amplitude}$$ = 3 units\\n- $$\\textbf{Number of nodes}$$ = 6\\n- $$\\textbf{Number of antinodes}$$ = 6",
