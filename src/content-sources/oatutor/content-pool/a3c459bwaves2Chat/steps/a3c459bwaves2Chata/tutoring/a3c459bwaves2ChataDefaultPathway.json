Wavelength: The wavelength is the distance between two successive points that are in phase (for example, from crest to crest or trough to trough). From the graph, it looks like the wavelength (the distance between two crests or troughs) is approximately $$4$$ units.\\n$$2$$. Amplitude: The amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium (horizontal axis). The graph shows that the maximum displacement from the center is about $$1$$ unit.\\n$$3$$. Number of Nodes: Nodes are points where the wave crosses the equilibrium line (y $$=$$ 0). Counting the points where the graph crosses the horizontal axis, there are $$5$$ nodes visible.\\n$$4$$. Number of Antinodes: Antinodes are the points where the wave reaches its maximum amplitude, either positive or negative. In this graph, there are $$4$$ antinodes (2 crests and $$2$$ troughs).\\n\\nLet me know if you need further clarification!",
