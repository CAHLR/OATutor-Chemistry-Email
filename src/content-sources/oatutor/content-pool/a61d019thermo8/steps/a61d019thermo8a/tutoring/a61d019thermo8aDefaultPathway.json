For ideal gases, the specific heat capacity can be calculated based on whether the gas is monatomic or diatomic. For ideal gases, monatomic gases (like $$He$$ and $$Ne$$), typically have $$C_v = \\frac{3}{2}R$$, while diatomic gases (like $$H_2$$ and $$N_2$$) generally have $$C_v = \\frac{5}{2}R$$, where $$R$$ is the gas constant. Using these $$C_v$$ values will help you understand the heat $$Q$$ each gas absorbs under the heating process. Determine the $$C_v$$ values for these gases to understand their heating behavior.",
