        "text": "To calculate the wavelength of the gamma rays emitted by $$^{60}Co$$, we can use the formula that relates the speed of light ($$c$$), frequency ($$f$$), and wavelength ($$\\lambda$$): \\n $$\\lambda = \\frac{c}{f}$$ \\n Where:\\n- $$c$$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately $$3.00 \\times 10^8 m/s$$,\\n- $$f$$ is the frequency of the radiation, given as $$2.83 \\times 10^{20}s^{-1}$$.\\nLet's calculate the wavelength: $$\\lambda = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8 m/s}{2.83 \\times 10^{20} s^{-1}} = 1.06 \\times 10^{-12} m$$ \\n Now, to convert meters to nanometers (nm), we use the fact that $$1 m = 10^9 nm$$: \\n $$\\lambda = 1.06 \\times 10^{-12} m \\times 10^9 nm/m = 1.06 \\times 10^{-3} nm$$\\nThus, the wavelength of the gamma rays is $$1.06 \\times 10^{-3} nm$$.",
