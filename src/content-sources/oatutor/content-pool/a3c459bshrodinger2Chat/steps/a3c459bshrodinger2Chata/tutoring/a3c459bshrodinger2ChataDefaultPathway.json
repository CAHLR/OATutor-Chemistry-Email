        "text": "For the quantum numbers $$N = 3$$ and $$l = 2$$, we can break down the orbital characteristics as follows:\\n- $$\\textbf{Principal Quantum Number (N)}$$: This indicates the energy level and the size of the orbital. $$N = 3$$ corresponds to the third energy level.\\n- $$\\textbf{Azimuthal Quantum Number (l)}$$: This defines the shape of the orbital. $$l = 2$$ corresponds to a d-orbital, which typically has a more complex shape than s- or p-orbitals.\\nFor $$N = 3$$ and $$l = 2$$, the orbital in question is a $$\\textbf{3d orbital}$$. Now, let's break down the nodes:\\n- $$\\textbf{Radial nodes}$$: The number of radial nodes is given by $$N - l - 1$$. For this case: $$3 - 2 - 1 = 0$$, meaning there are no radial nodes.\\n- $$\\textbf{Angular nodes}$$: The number of angular nodes is equal to $$l$$, which in this case is 2 angular nodes.\\nThus, the orbital has $$\\textbf{2 angular nodes}$$ and $$\\textbf{0 radial nodes}$$.\\nIn terms of visual representation, option $$\\textbf{c}$$ is the correct image that represents the 3d orbital. This is because the shape of the 3d orbitals typically has two angular nodes and the complex lobe structure shown in the image corresponds to the $$l = 2$$ state.",
