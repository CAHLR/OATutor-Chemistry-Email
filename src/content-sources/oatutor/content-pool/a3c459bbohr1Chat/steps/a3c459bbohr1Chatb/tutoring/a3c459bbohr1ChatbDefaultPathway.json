        "text": "The color of light emitted is determined by its wavelength. The wavelength of the photon emitted, as calculated, is $$\\textbf{699.93 nm}$$. In the visible spectrum:\\n-Violet light ranges from about 380 to 450 nm,\\n-Blue light from 450 to 495 nm,\\n-Green light from 495 to 570 nm,\\n-Yellow light from 570 to 590 nm,\\n-Orange light from 590 to 620 nm,\\n-$$\\textbf{Red light ranges from 620 to 750 nm}$$.\\nSince the wavelength 699.93 nm falls within the range for red light, the photon emitted corresponds to $$\\textbf{red light}$$.",
