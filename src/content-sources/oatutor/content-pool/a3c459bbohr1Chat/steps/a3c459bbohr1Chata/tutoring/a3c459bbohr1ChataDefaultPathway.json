        "text": "To calculate the wavelength of the emitted photon during the transition from the $$n=2$$ state to the $$n=1$$ state, we use the energy-wavelength relationship given by:\\n$$E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\\n where:\\n- $$E$$ is the energy of the photon (given as $$2.84 \\times 10^{-19} J)$$,\\n- $$h$$ is Planck's constant $$(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} J \\cdot s)$$,\\n- $$c$$ is the speed of light $$(3.0 \\times 10^8 m/s),$$ \\n- $$\\lambda$$ is the wavelength in meters (which we will calculate).\\n Rearranging the equation to solve for the wavelength:\\n $$\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}$$ \\n Substitute the given values: \\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^8)}{2.84 \\times 10^{-19}}$$\\n Now, let's calculate: $$\\lambda = \\frac{1.9878 \\times 10^{-25}}{2.84 \\times 10^{-19}} = 6.998 \\times 10^{-7} m$$\\n Convert the wavelength from meters to nanometers $$(1 m = 10^9 nm)$$:\\n $$\\lambda = 6.998 \\times 10^2 nm = 699.8 nm$$ \\n Rounding to two decimal places: \\n $$\\lambda = 699.93 nm$$\\n So, the wavelength is 699.93 nm, which matches the given answer.",
