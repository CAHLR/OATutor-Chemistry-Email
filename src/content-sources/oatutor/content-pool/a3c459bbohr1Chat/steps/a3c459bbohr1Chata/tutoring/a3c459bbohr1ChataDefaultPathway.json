        "text": "To calculate the wavelength corresponding to the energy of the photon emitted, we can use the relationship between energy and wavelength:\\n\\nE $$=$$ $$\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\\n\\nWhere:\\n- E is the energy of the photon $$(2.84$$ $$\\times$$ 10**{-19} $$\\$$, $$\\text{J})$$\\n- $$h$$ is Planck's constant $$(6.626$$ $$\\times$$ 10**{-34} $$\\$$, $$\\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s})$$\\n- c is the speed of light $$(3.00$$ $$\\times$$ $${10}^8$$ $$\\$$, \\text{m/s})$$\\n- $$\\lambda$$ is the wavelength in meters (which we will calculate)\\n\\nFirst, solve for $$\\lambda$$: $$\\n$$ $$\\n$$ $$\\lambda$$ $$=$$ $$\\frac{hc}{E}$$\\n\\nSubstitute the given values into the equation:\\n\\n$$\\lambda$$ $$=$$ $$\\frac{(6.626$$ $$\\times$$ 10**{-34} $$\\$$, $$\\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s})$$ $$\\times$$ $$(3.00$$ $$\\times$$ $${10}^8$$ $$\\$$, \\text{m/s})}{2.84 $$\\times$$ 10**{-19} $$\\$$, $$\\text{J}}$$\\n\\nNow, calculate the wavelength. I'll compute that for you.\\n\\nThe calculated wavelength of the photon is approximately $$699.93$$ nm, rounded to two decimal places.",
