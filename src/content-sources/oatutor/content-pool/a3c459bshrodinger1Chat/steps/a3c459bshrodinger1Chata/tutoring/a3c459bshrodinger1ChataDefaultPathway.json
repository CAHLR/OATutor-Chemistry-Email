        "text": "The orbital described by the quantum numbers $$n = 4$$ and $$l = 1$$ corresponds to a 4p orbital. Here's the reasoning: \\n - $$\\textbf{Principal quantum number (n)}$$: This represents the energy level of the electron. In this case, $$n = 4$$ means the electron is in the 4th energy level.\\n- $$\\textbf{Azimuthal quantum number (l)}$$: This defines the shape of the orbital. The value of $$l$$ is associated with the type of orbital:\\n- $$l = 0$$ corresponds to an s orbital.\\n- $$l = 1$$ corresponds to a p orbital.\\n- $$l = 2$$ corresponds to a d orbital.\\n- $$l = 3$$ corresponds to an f orbital.\\nSince $$l = 1$$, the orbital is a $$\\textbf{p orbital}$$. Combining this with $$n = 4$$, the orbital is identified as $$\\textbf{4p}$$.",
