        "text": "To solve this, we need to find the ratio of the number of neutrons to protons in the nucleus of a 145Pm (Promethium) atom.\\n\\n$$1$$. Atomic number (Z) of Promethium (Pm):\\nPromethium has an atomic number of $$61$$. This means that a 145Pm nucleus has $$61$$ protons.\\n\\n$$2$$. Mass number (A) of 145Pm:\\nThe mass number (145) represents the total number of protons and neutrons combined.\\n\\n$$3$$. Number of neutrons (N):\\nThe number of neutrons is given by the difference between the mass number and the atomic number:\\n\\nN $$=$$ A - Z $$=$$ $$145$$ - $$61$$ $$=$$ $$84$$ \\text{ neutrons}.\\n\\n$$4$$. Ratio of neutrons to protons:\\nThe ratio of neutrons to protons is:\\n\\nRatio $$=$$ $$\\frac{\\text{Neutrons}}{\\text{Protons}$$} $$=$$ $$\\frac{84}{61}.$$\\n\\nThus, the ratio of neutrons to protons in a 145Pm nucleus is $$\\frac{84}{61}$$ or approximately $$1.38$$.",
