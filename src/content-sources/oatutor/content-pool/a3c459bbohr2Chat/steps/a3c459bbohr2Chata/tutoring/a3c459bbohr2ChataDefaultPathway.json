        "text": "The diagram you provided shows the energy levels (labeled as $$n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$$) of an electron in an atom. In this context, an electronic transition occurs when an electron moves from a higher energy level to a lower one, releasing a photon in the process.\\nTo determine which transition emits a photon with the highest frequency, we must consider the energy difference between the levels. According to the equation for the energy of a photon:\\n$$E = h \\cdot f$$ \\n where $$E$$ is the energy difference, $$h$$ is Planck's constant, and $$f$$ is the frequency. The larger the energy difference $$(E)$$, the higher the frequency of the emitted photon.\\nThe transition from $$n=5$$ to $$n=1$$ corresponds to the largest energy difference because it spans the most levels, resulting in the highest frequency for the emitted photon. Therefore, the transition $$5 \\to 1$$ emits a photon with the highest frequency.",
