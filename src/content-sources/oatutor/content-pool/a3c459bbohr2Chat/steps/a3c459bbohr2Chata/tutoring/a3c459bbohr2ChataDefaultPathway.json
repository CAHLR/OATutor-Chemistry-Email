        "text": "The energy-level diagram provided shows different energy levels (n $$=$$ $$1$$, $$2$$, $$3$$, $$4$$, 5) for an electron around a nucleus. According to quantum theory, the frequency of the photon emitted during an electronic transition is directly related to the difference in energy between the two levels.\\n\\nFor a photon to be emitted with the highest frequency, the electron must transition from a higher energy level to a much lower energy level. This is because the energy of a photon (and hence its frequency) is given by the equation:\\n\\nE $$=$$ $$h$$ $$\\nu$$ $$=$$ $$\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\\n\\nWhere:\\n- E is the energy difference between the two levels,\\n- $$h$$ is Planck's constant,\\n- $$\\nu$$ is the frequency of the photon,\\n- c is the speed of light, and\\n- $$\\lambda$$ is the wavelength.\\n\\nFrom the diagram, the transition with the largest energy difference occurs when the electron moves from $$n$$ $$=$$ $$5$$ (the highest level shown) to $$n$$ $$=$$ $$1$$ (the lowest level). This transition would result in the emission of a photon with the highest energy and therefore the highest frequency.\\n\\nThus, the electronic transition from $$n$$ $$=$$ $$5$$ to $$n$$ $$=$$ $$1$$ would emit a photon with the highest frequency.",
