        "text": "Based on the emission line spectra shown in the first image and the energy-level diagrams provided in the second image, option $$\\textbf{b}$$ is the correct answer because the pattern of energy levels corresponds to the emission lines in the spectrum.\\nHereâ€™s why:\\n-The emission lines represent transitions between energy levels. The more lines present, the more energy levels involved in the transitions.\\n-In the spectrum, there are three blue lines followed by a red line. This suggests that there are four transitions, with one being of higher energy (red shift).\\n-In energy-level diagram $$\\textbf{b}$$, the evenly spaced lines match the four distinct energy levels that would account for the transitions seen in the spectrum.\\nThis alignment confirms that the transitions are accurately represented in energy-level diagram $$\\textbf{b}$$.",
